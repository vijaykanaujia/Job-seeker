    <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Finding a job</h5>
    <p>To maximise your chances of finding an internship, apply for multiple jobs, as far in advance as
	possible. Remember you will be competing against local talent, so make sure your CV/Resume
	and supporting letters standout.
	</p>	
				<p>If your application is successful, employers will often conduct either telephone or Skype
	interviews.
	</p>
				<p>Your university careers centre will be able to help with interview tips and how to write a
	CV/Resume.

    <h5 class="mt-0">Visas & Work Permits</h5>
    <p>You may need a Visa/Work permit to intern abroad</p>			
	<p>Several countries offer ‘Working Holiday’ visas. These are specifically designed for those
	looking to work and travel, usually for up to a 12-month period and so are perfect for internships.
	To check which countries offer working holiday visas and for further information, click here, or
	visit the government/embassy website of the respective country.
	</p>
	<p>If you are an EU, EEA or UK* citizen and wish to intern in the UK or another EU/EEA country,
	you don’t need to apply for a visa or work permit.</p>
				<p>To intern in other countries that don’t offer a working holiday visa, you will need to check that
	country's government or embassy website, to ascertain what type of visa/work permit you will
	need to apply for. Usually you can apply for a temporary work permit/visa.</p>
	<p>
		*UK citizens are presently eligible to intern in all EU countries. However, since leaving the EU,
		this may change. Keep an eye out on the UK government website.

    <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Flights/Accommodation</h5>
    <p>
    	Often employers will assist in finding you a suitable place to stay. If not, google local estate
		agents or flat share sites to find accommodation. Sometimes local universities may offer
		accommodation to those interning abroad.
	</p>
	<p>
		Again, employers will often assist with flights (and sometimes pay for them). Flight comparison
		sites are a great place to find cheap flights.
	</p>
	<p>That’s it. So, what are you waiting for? GET OUT THERE!</p>
