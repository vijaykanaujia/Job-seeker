			<h1>Hungry Interns - What We Do</h1>
			<p>An internship abroad will be one of the best experiences of your lifetime (trust us), plus it will
significantly increase your chances of future employability. Don’t think it is too difficult to find an
internship abroad on your own, just follow the key steps below</p>
			<h2>Finding a job</h2>
			<p>To maximise your chances of finding an internship, apply for multiple jobs, as far in advance as
possible. Remember you will be competing against local talent, so make sure your CV/Resume
and supporting letters standout.
</p>	
			<p>If your application is successful, employers will often conduct either telephone or Skype
interviews.
</p>
			<p>Your university careers centre will be able to help with interview tips and how to write a
CV/Resume.
</p>
			<h2>Visas & Work Permits</h2>
			<p>You may need a Visa/Work permit to intern abroad</p>			
			<p>Several countries offer ‘Working Holiday’ visas. These are specifically designed for those
looking to work and travel, usually for up to a 12-month period and so are perfect for internships.
To check which countries offer working holiday visas and for further information, click here, or
visit the government/embassy website of the respective country.
</p>
			<h2>If you are an EU, EEA or UK* citizen and wish to intern in the UK or another EU/EEA country,
you don’t need to apply for a visa or work permit.</h2>
			<p>To intern in other countries that don’t offer a working holiday visa, you will need to check that
country's government or embassy website, to ascertain what type of visa/work permit you will
need to apply for. Usually you can apply for a temporary work permit/visa.</p>
			<h2>Flights/Accommodation</h2>
			<p>Often employers will assist in finding you a suitable place to stay. If not, google local estate
agents or flat share sites to find accommodation. Sometimes local universities may offer
accommodation to those interning abroad.
</p>
			<p>Again, employers will often assist with flights (and sometimes pay for them). Flight comparison
sites are a great place to find cheap flights.
</p>
			<p>That’s it. So, what are you waiting for? GET OUT THERE!</p>
			<p>*UK citizens are presently eligible to intern in all EU countries. However, since leaving the EU,
this may change. Keep an eye out on the UK government website.</p>
			
			<h2>Universities</h2>
			<p>University? We are keen to work with you! For further information and details on how your
students can access our jobs database, please email us at; <a href="mailto:universities@hungryinterns.com">universities@hungryinterns.com</a></p>
			<p>We will get back to you within 24 hours.
