			<h2>Finding a job</h2>
			<p>To maximise your chances of finding an internship, apply for multiple jobs, as far in advance as
possible. Remember you will be competing against local talent, so make sure your CV/Resume
and supporting letters standout.
</p>	
			<p>If your application is successful, employers will often conduct either telephone or Skype
interviews.
</p>
			<p>Your university careers centre will be able to help with interview tips and how to write a
CV/Resume.
</p>
			<h2>Visas & Work Permits</h2>
			<p>You may need a Visa/Work permit to intern abroad</p>			
			<p>Several countries offer ‘Working Holiday’ visas. These are specifically designed for those
looking to work and travel, usually for up to a 12-month period and so are perfect for internships.
To check which countries offer working holiday visas and for further information, click here, or
visit the government/embassy website of the respective country.
</p>
			<h2>If you are an EU, EEA or UK* citizen and wish to intern in the UK or another EU/EEA country,
you don’t need to apply for a visa or work permit.</h2>
			<p>To intern in other countries that don’t offer a working holiday visa, you will need to check that
country's government or embassy website, to ascertain what type of visa/work permit you will
need to apply for. Usually you can apply for a temporary work permit/visa.</p>
			<h2>Flights/Accommodation</h2>
			<p>Often employers will assist in finding you a suitable place to stay. If not, google local estate
agents or flat share sites to find accommodation. Sometimes local universities may offer
accommodation to those interning abroad.
</p>
			<p>Again, employers will often assist with flights (and sometimes pay for them). Flight comparison
sites are a great place to find cheap flights.
</p>
			<p>That’s it. So, what are you waiting for? GET OUT THERE!</p>
			<p>*UK citizens are presently eligible to intern in all EU countries. However, since leaving the EU,
this may change. Keep an eye out on the UK government website.</p>
			
			<h2>Universities</h2>
			<p>University? We are keen to work with you! For further information and details on how your
students can access our jobs database, please email us at; <a href="mailto:universities@hungryinterns.com">universities@hungryinterns.com</a></p>
			<p>We will get back to you within 24 hours.
